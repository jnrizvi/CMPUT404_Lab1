Question 1:

Question 2:
2.20.0

Question 3:
2.25.1

Question 4:
Installing requests with pip likely installed an older version because it wasn't pip3.
I created the venv for python3 and installed within it so different version inside venv.

Question 5:
Status code was "301 Moved Permanently". I would need to visit the URL that specifies where the new location is.
http://www.google.com/

Question 6:
The status code is 301, and so it the one returned by curl -i.
Sending curl -i http://www.google.com/teapot returns the status code 418.

Question 7:
After comparing both results with a diffchecker, there were no substantial differences in the outputs.
POST is used to send data to a URL, and a data payload is needed.
